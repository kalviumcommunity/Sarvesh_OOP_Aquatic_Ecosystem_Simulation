# Aquatic Ecosystem Simulation

## Introduction

The **Aquatic Ecosystem Simulation** is a basic Java project designed to demonstrate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The simulation models a simplified aquatic environment with different types of fish and underwater plants, each represented as objects in the system.

## Overview

In this project, you'll find two primary classes: `Fish` and `Plant`. The `Fish` class simulates the behavior of various fish species, including their movement and feeding habits. The `Plant` class represents underwater vegetation and its basic characteristics. This simulation helps illustrate the use of classes and objects in Java, encapsulating real-world entities into a programmatic environment.

The project is focused on showcasing how OOP concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation can be used to build a simple yet meaningful simulation of an aquatic ecosystem.
